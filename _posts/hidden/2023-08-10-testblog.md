mark down 还有多少语法可以用？

# ***This is a markdown quick reference***   

# reverse \
use \\ before anything (including codeblcks) to reverse

special: &lt; &amp; must use this
& / < for HTML item - auto convert

# Titles
 1 \# with a spacebar means title(multiple \# for inferior titles)   

 or put ============= only at the bottom of a line for 1st title , ------- for 2nd title    

# nextline and paragraph
 sentences with a whole empty line stands for a paragraph   

 sentences with several spacebars or < br > means nextline<br> 

# **Boldtext** and *italictext* 
 use \*\* at the sides of the space where you want to **bold**  

 use \* at the sides of the space where you want to go *italic*  

 ***They can also go together***   

# quoted text
use \> before a paragraph for indicating it's quotation

> like , this

>fill \> between paragraphs for multiparagraph quotation
>
> like this

>also we have
>>multiple layers!

# lists
### organized list
1. to make a list  
8. format goes as _x. _  
3. start with 1 and anynumber else(auto re-mark)
   
### unorganized list

    OS.showcopyright()

or a pair of  \`  `single indicating`   
and also `` double mark for `double` quotes``

# seperate lines:
